1. Do the following:
   - Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Community version - you need this step to build Insightface)
   - OR only [VS C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and select "Desktop Development with C++" under "Workloads -> Desktop & Mobile"

2. Go to the `ComfyUI\custom_nodes` directory
3. Open Console and run `git clone https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node`
4. Run `install.bat`
5. (From the version 0.3.0) Download facerestorers models from the links below and put them into the `ComfyUI\custom_nodes\comfyui-reactor-node\models\facerestore_models` directory:
   - CodeFormer: https://github.com/sczhou/CodeFormer/releases/download/v0.1.0/codeformer.pth
   - GFPGAN: https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.4/GFPGANv1.4.pth
6. Run ComfyUI and find there ReActor Node inside the menu `image/postprocessing` or by using a search

</details>

## Usage

Just connect all required nodes and run the query.

### Face Restoration

From the version 0.3.0 ReActor Node has a buil-in face restoration.<br>Just download the models you want (see [Installation](#installation) instruction) and select one of them to restore the resulting face(s) during the faceswap. It will enhance face details and make your result more accurate.

### Face Indexes

ReActor detects faces in images in the following order:<br>left->right, top->bottom

And if you need to specify faces, you can set indexes for source and input images.

Index of the first detected face is 0.

You can set indexes in the order you need.<br>
E.g.: 0,1,2 (for Source); 1,0,2 (for Input).<br>This means: the second Input face (index = 1) will be swapped by the first Source face (index = 0) and so on.

### Genders

You can specify the gender to detect in images.<br>
ReActor will swap a face only if it meets the given condition.

## Troubleshooting

<a name="insightfacebuild">

### **I. (For Windows users) If you still cannot build Insightface for some reasons or just don't want to install Visual Studio or VS C++ Build Tools - do the following:**

1. (ComfyUI Portable) From the root folder check the version of Python:<br>run CMD and type `python_embeded\python.exe -V`
2. Download prebuilt Insightface package [for Python 3.10](https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/Insightface/insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl) or [for Python 3.11](https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/Insightface/insightface-0.7.3-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl) (if in the previous step you see 3.11) and put into the stable-diffusion-webui (A1111 or SD.Next) root folder (where you have "webui-user.bat" file) or into ComfyUI root folder if you use ComfyUI Portable
3. From the root folder run:
   - (SD WebUI) CMD and `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - (ComfyUI Portable) run CMD
4. Then update your PIP:
   - (SD WebUI) `python -m pip install -U pip`
   - (ComfyUI Portable) `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -U pip`
5. Then install Insightface:
   - (SD WebUI) `pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl`
   - (ComfyUI Portable) `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl`
6. Enjoy!

### **II. "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'"**

This error may occur if there's smth wrong with the model file `inswapper_128.onnx`

Try to download it manually from [here](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion-assets/releases/download/models/inswapper_128.onnx)
and put it to the `ComfyUI\custom_nodes\comfyui-reactor-node\models\insightface` replacing existing one

### **III. "reactor.execute() got an unexpected keyword argument 'reference_image'"**

This means that input points have been changed with the latest update<br>
Remove the current ReActor Node from your workflow and add it again

### **IV. ControlNet Aux Node IMPORT failed error when using with ReActor Node**

1. Close ComfyUI if it runs
2. Go to the ComfyUI root folder, open CMD there and run:
   - `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip uninstall -y opencv-python opencv-contrib-python opencv-python-headless`
   - `python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install opencv-python==4.7.0.72`
3. That's it!

## Updating

Just put .bat or .sh script from this [Repo](https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-extensions-updater) to the `ComfyUI\custom_nodes` directory and run it when you need to check for updates
